How to setup the google report app with Enonic XP.

:toc:

## Tracking

Setting up the tracking is only adding one value to the application set on the site

The app requires a google analytics acount setup for the site you want to track.

In google analytics go to admin settings

The admin button is located on the bottom left

There should be a datastream connected to the site for tracking

Opening up the data stream and select the one for the site we want to track.

Find its measureId and copy the value. (Use the icon next to it)

Now we jsut need to add this value to our site in Enonic

Just login to the server.
If you have not allready installed the google report application do that in the application tool found when opening the dashboard.

In content studio add the application to your site
And open up settings for this app (pencil icon)

In the site settings simply add a new measureId and enable tracking.

Thats it. If you publish the site now the tracking will be live and you can track user data.

## Widget

Setting up the widget is a bit more complicated, but gives a nice overview over the statistics of the site.
